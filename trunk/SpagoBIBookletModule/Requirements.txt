Before using the SpagoBI 1.9.1 Booklet module you must install some required third part software and
configure some settings.


Software required:

- Open Office 2.0.0

Software suggested:

- jbpm eclipse workflow designer 

Settings:

- Open office has to be executed as a server, so, 
  go into the directory OPENOFFICE-HOME/program and exec the following command 
  soffice -quickstart -accept="socket,host=0,port=9000;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager"
  This command could open a new open office window. In order to avoid this behaviour you can add -invisible as command line argument. 
  Anytime you launch the soffice command a new soffice process is created and so, if you use the -invisible argument, the only way  to stop open office is to kill the process.

- Open office has to be configured to save the presentation document as powerpoint 
  and to store the content of the images (not their path), so:
  - Open the open office impress application and go to tools/options
  - select the load and save category
  - select the general subcategory
  - be sure that the "Save URL relative to filesystem" is not checked
  - choose the "powerpoint" save format for the presentation document (standard file format part)
