	     SpagoBI is a Business Intelligence Free Platform, completely realized according to the free software philosophy.
	     It is a suite of coordinated and integrated tools allowing the development of a specific BI solution in every 
	     business area and market segment. SpagoBI has a modular structure integrated into the core system. 
	     It guarantees solidity and harmony to the platform and a great extension capability. 
	     <br></br>
	     Not all the SpagoBI modules are always necessary for every project: you can use the appropriate SpagoBI module
	     for your project. You can start using a single module with the guarantee that further extensions will be easy 
	     because everything is inserted in an overall vision. 
	     <br></br>
	     SpagoBI uses many technologies and products already available as Free Open Source Software: the first one is 
	     Spago, the J2EE Framework already released by 
	     Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. and Sinapsi. 
	     Therefore, SpagoBI inherits Spago's features and technical characteristics, using them in its specific context:
		<ul>	
		 <li>it manages specific Business Intelligence objects as reports, OLAP analysis, Dashboards and Scorecards views and Data 			     Mining models;
                 </li>
		<li>it is focused on data management and on information content and context;</li>
		<li>it supports the BI systems's administrators in the control, validation, certification and distribution process of the 			     Business Intelligence objects.
  		</li>
		</ul>
		According to its developement road-map, the main SpagoBI features will be the following:
		<ul>
			<li><b>BI Portlets</b>: every BI object will be distributed for the end-user through portlet 
			technology (JSR 168). In this way portlets and the BI objects will be managed and encapsulated 
			into the portal already chosen for the specific enterprise solution (even if the portal is realized
			 by means of commercial products).</li>

			<li><b>Reporting, OLAP Analysis, Data Mining, Dashboards and Scorecards</b> are the BI objects 
			managed by SpagoBI, everyone with its own execution engine and development environment. SpagoBI 
			manages the production and validation cycles, the parametric activation, the navigation, the 
			results versioning and storage in a similar way although every BI object maintains its distinctive 
			characteristics.</li>
				<ul>
			        <br></br>
				<li><b>Reports</b> realize the structured information views; they have a greater diffusion level 
				according to a static structure (.pdf, .xls, .csv, .html, etc). SpagoBI enables the navigation 
				capability between different reports, inheriting the parameters.</li>
				<li>The multidimensional structures for the <b>OLAP</b> analysis add a higher degree of freedom 
				and variability. The analysis axis and the observation measures are structured, this enables
				to obtain a data examination at various detail levels and from various perspectives, by 
				means of drill-down, drill-across, slice and dice operations.</li>

				<li>In the <b>Management Performance</b> context, SpagoBI provides many widgets for 
				dashboards structuring and the parametric evaluation of performance scores.</li>
				<li><b>Data Mining</b> algorithms and processes (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, etc.) will enable 
				data analysis, with the aim to find out hidden information. SpagoBI support Data Mining 
				models implementations and their results analysis trough the other Business Intelligence 
				objects.</li>
			        <br></br>
				</ul>
			<li><b>Query-by-example</b>: it offers a visual mode for data inquiring. It is possible to save the structure
			 as a template for subsequent reports development, or to export the results for external elaborations
		        (ex. cvs, XML).</li>

			<li><b>Interaction with source systems</b>: it provides connectors, protocols and services for bidirectional data 
			exchange with source systems.</li>
			<li><b>Meta Repository</b>: SpagoBI is a really integrated platform instead of a confused set of 
			products thanks to metadata. The meta-repository contains all information about data (technical 
			and business metadata), processes and rules for the platform management.</li>
			<li><b>Users profile</b>: it is possible to differentiate the functionalities access rights according to the user's role.</li>
			<li><b>Documents management</b>: it is a versioned repository for all the relevant results provided 
			by the BI objects, in a scheduled way too. Research and detection functionalities for these 
			documents are provided.</li>
			<li><b>Scheduling</b>: an off-line activation of all transport and/or import/export data processes, document production, 
			storage and destruction, etc. is provided.</li>

			<li><b>Workflow</b>: SpagoBI manages the approval and certification flow for BI objects and for the 
			relative elaborated documents.</li>
			<li><b>Administration</b>: it concerns in a support to the management functionalities of the whole platform.</li>
			<li><b>Logging/Auditing</b>: corresponding to some control services for the platform's functional and performance monitoring.</li>
