	SpagoBI is a Business Intelligence platform that allows to develop business objects following a common workflow: development, test, 		release and use. Every object must pass through different states: 

	<ul>	
		<li>develop: the configuration of the objects is under costruction</li>
		<li>test: the object must be tested to control if it executes without errors and produces the correct output</li>
		<li>realesed: the object is correct and can be used from users</li> 
		<li>suspended: used when the object is not more useful</li>
   	</ul>

	Every developed object is placed in a folders tree structure on which access restrictions can be established, so, based on the tree 		location, the object can be in a  developing/testing state, so may be  executed from different users. Each object can be executed with different user roles and 		it's possible to assign to each role different masks of params for the objects.

        <br/><br/>
         
	SpagoBI can be used by four user categories: 
        <ul>
		<li>Administrators: configure the SpagoBI environment and assign permissions</li>
		<li>Developers: develop the configuration for the business objects execution, like parameter values and constraints. 			After the development they can execute the object in order to test if any error occurs. In case the object execute correctly 			they can pass the object to the test phase</li>
		<li>Testers: test each object by simulating all users allowed to execute it and if the object presents always the right output 			they can pass the object to the realed state</li>
  		<li>Users: execute the objects for which tey have the permissions</li>
	</ul>

	Each category of users can use SpagoBI with different modalities, in order to perform different operations, so, when the user 		autenticates itself, his home page will be different, while it is  based on the category to which the user belongs.
