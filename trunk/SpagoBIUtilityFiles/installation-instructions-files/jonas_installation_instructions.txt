If you want to install SpagoBI on your JOnAS-eXo server, after having launched Maven 2 command, please proceed as follows:
- copy the content of the folder "jonas-server" (NOT the directory itself but only its content) inside your JOnAD base directory (we will refer to it as JONAS_HOME): overwrite the existing files;
- delete the jar hsqldb-1.8.0.1.jar from JONAS_HOME/lib/apps;
- delete the jar dom4j-1.6.1.jar from JONAS_HOME/lib/apps;

For CMS:
- open the file cms.xml in JONAS_HOME/apps/autoload/exoplatform.ear/spagobi.war/WEB-INF/conf and substitute ${SERVER_HOME} with the actual path of JONAS_HOME in the following parameters definition: "repository_path" and "conf_file_path".
Pay attention at the path form, also for Windows system it must contain only / separator and it must start with / (no c:\ for example);
