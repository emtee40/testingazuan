========================= INSTALL BO ENGINE FROM BINARIES ===========================In order to install the BOEngine you need: - The access to the bo cluster directory of your wijsp application.  An example path of this folder is:  BO_HOME\BusinessObjects Enterprise 6\nodes\bo\mycluster\APACHE FOR TOMCAT\MasterWebServer-0.0.0.0_8085\wijsp- The access to the wijsp application folder of yours Business Object 6.5 installation.  An example path of this folder is:  BO_HOME\ThirdParties\tomcat\webapps\wijspUnzip the file SpagoBIBOEngine.war in a folder: in the following we will refer to this folder as BOENGINE_HOME,to the wijsp installation folder as WI_HOME, to the wijsp cluster folder as WI_CLUSTER.Proceed as follows:- copy the following libraries from WI_HOME/WEB-INF/lib into BOENGINE_HOME/WEB-INF/lib    - asf_java.jar    - bo_orb.jar    - cs_bridge.jar    - encrypt.jar    - infoview.jar    - webi.jar    - wiserv.jar    - witools.jar    - ws_ade.jar    - wstk_java.jar    - copy the file wilog.tld from WI_HOME/WEB-INF into BOENGINE_HOME/WEB-INF- copy the folder language from WI_CLUSTER/viewers/cdz to BOENGINE_HOME- copy the following javascript files from WI_CLUSTER/viewers/cdz to BOENGINE_HOME/jsp    - bomenuDOM.js    - bomenuIE.js    - bomenuNS.js    - browserDetection.js    - drillcontext.js    - drillcontextDOM.js    - copy the following files from WI_HOME/WEB-INF/classes into BOENGINE_HOME/WEB-INF/classes    - charset.properties    - defaultConfig.xml    - licenses.txt    - log4j.properties    - mycluster.cfg    - webi.properties    - webiviewer.properties    - wstk_bridge.xml    - open the file webi.properties just copied and change the value of TEMP_DIR property  with the path of an existing folder of your file system- open the BOENGINE_HOME/WEB-INF/web.xml file and change the user id and password   with two values suitable for your bo installation. Remember that bo engine will use always  this credential to log. The access restrinction are already defined into SpagoBI. - zip the content of the folder BOENGINE_HOME (only the content, not the folder itself)   in a file called SpagoBIBOEngine.war- be sure that the bo driver jar file has been copied into the WEB-INF/lib folder  of your SpagoBI web application folder- copy the SpagoBIBOEngine.war inside an application server.  Example: if it is a Tomcat server, copy the war inside tomcat-home-dir/webapps and start the server.- enter the SpagoBI setting portlet and define a new external Engine with:    - url = http://{server address}:{port}/SpagoBIBOEngine/BOServlet    	obviously replace {server address} and {port} with the correct values for your application server where     	SpagoBIBOEngine.war was deployed    - driver name = it.eng.spagobi.drivers.bo.BODriver    - document type = Report
