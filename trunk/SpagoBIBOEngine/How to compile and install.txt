========================= COMPILE BO ENGINE ===========================In order to compile the BOEngine you need: - Eclipse 3.2 with WTP - The access to the bo cluster directory of your wijsp application  an example path of this folder is:  BO_HOME\BusinessObjects Enterprise 6\nodes\bo\mycluster\APACHE FOR TOMCAT\MasterWebServer-0.0.0.0_8085\wijsp- The access to the wijsp application folder of yours Business Object 6.5 installation  an example path of this folder is:  BO_HOME\ThirdParties\tomcat\webapps\wijspIn the following wi will refer to the wijsp installation folder as WI_HOME, to the wijsp cluster folder as  WI_CLUSTER  and to the boengine project folder as BOENGINE_HOMEFirst of all import the project into Eclipse and then:- copy the following libraries from WI_HOME/WEB-INF/lib into BOENGINE_HOME/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib    - asf_java.jar    - bo_orb.jar    - cs_bridge.jar    - encrypt.jar    - infoview.jar    - webi.jar    - wiserv.jar    - witools.jar    - ws_ade.jar    - wstk_java.jar    - copy the file wilog.tld from WI_HOME/WEB-INF into BOENGINE_HOME/WebContent/WEB-INF- copy the folder language from WI_CLUSTER/viewers/cdz to BOENGINE_HOME/WebContent- copy the following javascript files from WI_CLUSTER/viewers/cdz to BOENGINE_HOME/WebContent/jsp    - bomenuDOM.js    - bomenuIE.js    - bomenuNS.js    - browserDetection.js    - drillcontext.js    - drillcontextDOM.js    - copy the following files from WI_HOME/WEB-INF/classes into BOENGINE_HOME/JavaSource    - charset.properties    - defaultConfig.xml    - licenses.txt    - log4j.properties    - mycluster.cfg    - webi.properties    - webiviewer.properties    - wstk_bridge.xml    - open the file webi.properties just copied and change the value of TEMP_DIR property  with the path of an existing folder of tour file system- open the BOENGINE_HOME/WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml file and change the user id and password   with two values suitable for your bo installation. Rember that bo engine will use always  this credential to log. The access restrinction are already defined into SpagoBI. - solve classpath problems (define the path for the classpath variables)- compile the project - export the project as a war application (boengine.war)========================= INSTALL BO ENGINE ===========================- be sure that the bo driver jar file has been copied into the web-inf/lib folder  of yours SpagoBI web applciation folder- copy the boengine.war inside an application server - enter the SpagoBI setting portlet and define a new external Engine with:    - url = http://server:port/SpagoBIBOEngine/BOServlet    - driver name = it.eng.spagobi.drivers.bo.BODriver
