SPAGOBI INSTALLATION ON EXO-ECM

According to the application server on which you are going to install SpagoBI and to the CMS system you prefer you can choose one of the following commands:

Application server	|	CMS system	|	command to run
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			|			|	
eXo-Tomcat		|	eXo-CMS		|	mvn -Ptomcat-server,exo-cms package
			|			|	
eXo-Tomcat		|	JackRabbit	|	mvn -Ptomcat-server,jackrabbit package
			|			|	
eXo-JBoss		|	eXo-CMS		|	mvn -Pjboss-server,exo-cms package
			|			|	
eXo-JBoss		|	JackRabbit	|	mvn -Pjboss-server,jackrabbit package
			|			|	
eXo-JOnAS		|	eXo-CMS		|	mvn -Pjonas-server,exo-cms package
			|			|	
eXo-JOnAS		|	JackRabbit	|	mvn -Pjonas-server,jackrabbit package
			|			|	

The command must be launched at command line from the folder containing "SpagoBIProject", "SpagoBIDriversAPI" .... folders.

A folder "build" will be created; inside it you will find a folder called "tomcat-server" or "jboss-server" or "jonas-server" according to the application server you chose. 
Please read the relevant installation file and follow its instructions.

Instead, if you want to produce spagobi.war, SpagoBIJasperResportEngine.war and SpagoBIJPivotEngine.war for exo-bi, run the command:

	mvn -Pbi package

You will find the 3 wars into the folder build/bi. Copy them into the "webapps" folder of your exo-tomcat installation.

At last you can run the command "mvn clean": this command will delete all the "target" directories in the sub-projects, but it will not delete the folder "build" in the main directory.
After having installed the application you can remove it manually.
