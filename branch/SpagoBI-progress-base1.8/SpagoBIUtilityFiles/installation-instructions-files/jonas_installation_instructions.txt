THIS DOCUMENT FOLLOWS THE FILE README.TXT IN THE SPAGOBI ROOT DIRECTORY.

If you want to install SpagoBI on your JOnAS server, after having launched Maven 2 command, please proceed as follows:
- copy the content of the folder "jonas-server" (NOT the directory itself but only its content) inside your JOnAD base directory (we will refer to it as JONAS_HOME): overwrite the existing files;
- delete the jar hsqldb-1.8.0.1.jar from JONAS_HOME/lib/apps;

For CMS:
- open the file jackrabbitSessionFactory.properties in JONAS_HOME/apps/autoload/exoplatform.ear/spagobi.war/WEB-INF/classes and substitute ${SERVER_HOME} with the actual path of JONAS_HOME.
Pay attention at the path form, also for Windows system it must contain only / separator and it must start with / (no c:\ for example);
