Requirements
eXo portal 1.1.2 installed over a JBoss server (see the eXo installation instructions)

If you want to install SpagoBI on your JBoss-eXo server, after having launched Maven 2 command, please proceed as follows:
- copy the content of the folder "jboss-server" (NOT the directory itself but only its content) inside your JBoss base directory (we will refer to it as JBOSS_HOME): overwrite the existing files;
- delete the jar hsqldb.jar from JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib;
- delete the jar commons-collections.jar from JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib;

For CMS:
- open the file cms.xml in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/exoplatform.ear/spagobi.war/WEB-INF/conf and substitute ${SERVER_HOME} with the actual path of JBOSS_HOME in the following parameters definition: "repository_path" and "conf_file_path".
Pay attention at the path form, also for Windows system it must contain only / separator and it must start with / (no c:\ for example);
