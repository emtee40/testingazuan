Introduction to SpagoBIDemo installation procedure.

SpagoBIDemo installation is going to be performed.
Before proceeding please checks the following system requirements:

- Exo-Tomcat 1.0 installed on your PC but never executed;
  ATTENTION: Exo-Tomcat must be downloaded from the Object Web repository
  and decompressed into a freE choice folder.
  (http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=151&release_id=791).
  For a correct functionality Exo-Tomcat doesn't have to be executed before the installation.
  The installation on a Exo-Tomcat already installed and used
  will result in a LOSS OF SERVER DATA.
