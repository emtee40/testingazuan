<table>  <tr>    <td style="text-align: justify">        SpagoBI inherits the MVC architectural pattern from the J2EE Spago Framework  wich is used for SpagoBI's development.
        Therefore, two remarks are relevant for the design of SpagoBI:
        <ul>
        	<li>It is possible to decline the MVC architectural pattern on the Business Intelligence aspects;</li>
        	<li>metadata play a primary role as focal point for the guide and the control of the entire platform.</li>
        </ul>
        According to these two simple principles, the MVC pattern characterizes itself here in this way:
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Model</b>: it's the layer that encapsulates the application logic, which now assumes the means of 
        	analytical logic. Business Intelligence specific objects (ex.: Reports, OLAP Analysis, Dashboard, etc.) 
        	are handled as generic BI Components with their own control logic and with a specific execution 
        	Engine/Server. Anyway, they remain application components which govern the business logic, where business is the 
        	analysis.</li>

        	<br></br>
        	About the data domain, it locates itself at a Data Warehouse level instead of at an operational level, 
        	even if that doesn't avoid the possibility to gain a considerable detail level. Finally, data domain 
        	involves metadata level for semantic data management and for the expression of the control logic.
        	<br></br>
        	<br></br>
        	<li><b>View</b>: adding to the problems of all the web applications concerning data publication and 
        	information distribution in this context it is necessary to keep and require documents and data with an 
        	historical validity. In analytical logics it is less necessary the manual inputs management by the end user.</li>
        	<br></br>
        	<li><b>Controller</b>: in the Business Intelligence the Controller takes the responsibility for coordination
        	and navigation across specific objects and between different modules. Therefore, it solves also the drill-down, 
        	drill-across, slice and dice requests with a less rigid logic than in web applications.</li>

	</ul>
        We will not continue in the description of how Spago implements the three MVC modules : we just say that SpagoBI 
        inherits the Spago's settings translating them in its specific way as follows:
        <ul>
        	<li><b>Delivery layer</b>, distributing information and analysis models;</li>
        	<li><b>Analytical layer</b>, transforming rough data in meaningful information;</li>

        	<li><b>Data and metadata layer</b>, receiving data and structuring them for analytical purposes. </li> 
        </ul>
		
		<BR></BR>

	In the <b>Delivery Layer</b>, portlets are the first way to access to the BI objects. It's possible to build your 
	custom interface in a new Business Intelligence Portal, or in a part of an existing one, by including the necessary
        portlets.<br></br>
	You can use Web Services for the interaction with other enterprise applications and with portals too. At last, 
	XML structures and models allow a simple transmission of the information and of the results. <br></br>

	<b>Analytical Layer</b> is the platform core which coordinates all the analytical activities supplying their 
	supporting tools. Its main components are Report, OLAP, Data Mining, Dashboard and Scorecards modules: each of 
	them corresponding to specific functionalities with the same architectural setting; it allows an easy learning 
	and a modular use. <br></br>  	   
	Some service applications support the core components effectiveness preparing the working environment in its 
	collateral aspects: parameters unified management, filters and domains, query by example capabilities, user and 
	object profiling systems, structuring of categories for documents classification, documents storage and search, 
	approval and management workflow. <br></br>  
	The Context Controller takes the responsibility for a successful coordination of the Core Components interaction and of
        their interaction with the service applications.<br></br>
	The <b>Data and Metadata Layer</b> locates itself at data warehouse level and provides a meta-description of its
        technical aspects and business meanings. A service repository to support document management  and object profiling
        is also provided.<br></br>
	The interaction with the core business components works in a native way or through a semantic interface layer.<br></br>

	Its relation with the source systems is organized by an ETL module, that provides some features for data extraction, 
	transformation and loading.<br></br>
	Finally, <b>administration</b> users are supported by many tools for the whole platform configuration and control.<br></br>
	Other information and details about the platform architecture are provided in the specific architectural design document.
