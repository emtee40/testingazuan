	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	The term <i><b>Business Intelligence</b></i> is so widely used to risk loosing a 
	proper meaning, because of the vastness and diversity of all the 
	realities it implies. For this reason we believe that first of all 
	it's useful to define what is the meaning of Business Intelligence 
	and how <b>SpagoBI</b> can support it.<br><br>
	
	In our opinion it is misleading the usage of the term <i>Business 
	Intelligence</i> in order to indifferently indicate static reports, 
	tools for their development, dimensional analysis, data organization 
	cubes, data warehousing or data mining models, them of all often 
	inserted into the context of a particular product or a particular 
	implementation. It's also partial and limitative the interpretation 
	of <i>Business Intelligence</i> as a separate collection of some of them.<br><br>
	
	<i>Business Intelligence</i> identifies a <b>solution</b> suitable for the building 
	of a coherent representation of one's own business. By means of a 
	direct and effective coordination of different fragmented applications 
	it is accessible from more points of view and with different degrees 
	of rights. This happens using all the tools listed before, organically 
	inserted into all the neuralgic cores of a particular business field.<br><br>
	
	So we aren't talking about a software development closed into a 
	specific product's boundaries or into a particular realization 
	(that often means the usage of a predefined software package), but we 
	are talking about a solution able to harmonically integrate:<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>the strategic vision for the own business and the relative functional competence;</li>
	<li>some specific tools (Data Warehousing, OLAP, Data Mining , Dashboard, ETL);</li>
	<li>a technological and applicative infrastructure allowing a fluent integration for the single modules.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<b>SpagoBI</b> is the technological and applicative infrastructure using the 
	most interesting existing Free Open Source Solutions (as reporting 
	engines, OLAP, Data Mining); it can be integrated with different 
	proprietary solutions too. In this way, it establishes the 
	technological and applicative precondition for the development of a 
	<b>Business Intelligence</b> solution inside a particular software 
	project: in fact, can not set aside the strategic vision your own 
	business and its consequent functional competence.
