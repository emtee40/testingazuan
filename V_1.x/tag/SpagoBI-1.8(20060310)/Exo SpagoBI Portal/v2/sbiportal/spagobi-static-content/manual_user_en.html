	<h3>End User</h3>

The end-user is characterized by his functional roles, which regulate:
<ul>
<li>the analytical documents visibility;</li>
<li>the visibility of the data shown by documents;</li>
<li>the behaviour rules of their parameters and the filters.</li>
</ul>
In more details, the user can use all the business objects in 'released' state, according to his role and with the modalities previously defined in the parameters configuration. 

<br/><br/>

The end-user navigates the documents tree in a specific portlet; the execution of the reached document may require a few additional information:
<ul>
<li>the functional role with which the user wants to introduce himself, when he covers many ones;</li>
<li>input parameters, which can be put-in through an insertion form built on the user's role.</li>
</ul>
Finally, the document is produced and shown on the same navigation portlet.

<br/><br/>

Even if the navigation portlet is enough to run all documents, the portal can be composed by several pages and sections: every portlet addresses a specific document, for a free composition of the informative scene and for an immediate view of the particular business context. 
For example, from the menu of this portal, you can access many sections: 
<ul>
<li>Home: many portlets which combine punctual views on performance indicators with  synthetic reports.</li>
<li>Navigation: free navigation on the functional tree of the documents.</li>
<li>Instanced Reports: page divided into subsections for the presentation of single reports already instanced (not parametrics).</li>
<li>Parametric Reports: page divided into subsections for the parametric activation of the reports with default values.</li>
<li>Olap: multidimensional analysis model.</li>
<li>Static Dashboard: synthetic and static presentation of historical series with especially interests.</li>
<li>Dynamic Dashboard: synthetic and dynamic presentation of the performance indicators values to be monitored at fixed time intervals.</li> 
<li>Manual: user manual.</li>
</ul>
