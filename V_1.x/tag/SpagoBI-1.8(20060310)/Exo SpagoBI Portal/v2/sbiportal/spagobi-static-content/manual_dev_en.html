	<h3>Developer functions</h3>

	The developer must register and configure its own analytical document inside SpagoBI, after its development. The configuration is referred to the parameters' activation, their presentation modalities and to all the controls to apply to the inserted values, according to the end-user's role.<br><br>
	
	<h4>Predefined lists of values</h4>	
	The developer defines all the recover techniques for the values to show to the end-user during the parameters allocation phase. A synthetic view of all the registered definitions is available. The developer can add new registrations, erase the existing ones and access to their detail information in order to modify them. In addition to some identifying data (label, name and description), he can use different parameters' composition and presentation typologies:
	<ul>
	<li>manual input, allowing the free parameters allocation;</li>
	<li>query, allowing the database retrieval of all the selected values;</li>
	<li>fixed list, allowing the organization of an arbitrary value list;</li>
	<li>method, allowing the registration of methods and classes to which delegate the recovering for all values to suggest.</li>
	</ul>
	According to the selected typology, a wizard is available in order to easy its specific composition, especially useful in case of an arbitrary list.<br><br>
	
	<h4>Predefined controls</h4>
	The developer can register some typologies of formal controls to apply to the values inserted into the documents activation‘s parameters. A synthetic view of all predefined controls and of all configurable controls is available. The developer can add new configurable controls, erase the existing ones or access to their detailed information in order to modify them. In addition to some identification data (label, name and description) it is possible to configure some different control typologies:
	<ul>
	<li>date: date formats control;</li>
	<li>regexp: control through regular expressions;</li>
	<li>min length: minimum number of characters for the inserted values;</li>
	<li>max length: maximum number of characters for the inserted values;</li>
	<li>range: to control a value included into two limits;</li>
	<li>decimal: decimal digits control.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Parameters registration</h4>
	SpagoBI handles the parameters in term of autonomous entities, each one with its own behaviour based on user's roles. So it is possible to associate to them different presentation modalities: the <i>predefined lists of values</i> and the <i>predefined controls</i>.<br>
	A synthetic list for all registered parameters is provided; it allows the developer to add new parameters, to erase the existing ones or to access to their detailed information in order to modify them. From the detailed page he can access to the parameter's use mode by means of a list-detail structure managing its association between presentation and control opportunities, according to the roles. A single role will be able to use one parameter in one modality. In this way, it is possible to register the controls and the typical views just one time, matching them with the parameters later, obtaining a great amount of reuse and a wide range of behaviours differentiations during the execution phase.<br><br>
	
	<h4>Documents registration</h4>
	Finally, the developer must register the developed analytical documents inside SpagoBI. For this aim, both a synthetic list and a tree-view supporting their functional subdivision is available. Both the two modalities allows adding a new document, erasing the existing ones or accessing to their detailed information in order to modify them.<br>
	The main attributes for the registration of a new document are:
	<ul>
	<li>the identifying data (label, name and description)</li>
	<li>the execution engine;</li>
	<li>the document's template;</li>
	<li>the document's position inside the functional tree-view.</li>
	</ul>
	Once that a document has been registered, the history of all loaded templates is kept and the developer can reload an old version of them every time. From the detailed view he can get the page that manages the execution parameters' configuration. By means of another list-detail structure he can choose the registered parameters, by specifying the heading of the input mask created during the execution phase. During this phase it isn't necessary to specify anymore about user's roles, because they are completely managed through the visibility rules of the functional tree-view and through the behavioural parameters description.<br>
	A just registered document is in a DEV (development) state and after the first execution (due to the developer) it moves to the TEST state, waiting for a formal correctness validation.
