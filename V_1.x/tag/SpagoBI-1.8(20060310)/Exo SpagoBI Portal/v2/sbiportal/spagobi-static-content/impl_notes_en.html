      <h3>Implementation note</h3>

      <h4>Portlet</h4>
      Portlets are autonomous and independent application windows. 
      They are freely usable inside portal contexts, supporting the JSR 168 
      specification, by means of a simple configuration and without 
      development needs.<br>

	  SpagoBI releases different portlets according to the different 
	  user's typologies (administrator, developer, tester, end-user). 
	  You can insert these portlets into your corporate portal or 
	  into a particular Business Intelligence environment.<br>
	  
	  This demo is organized in a very simple way, in order to keep 
	  your attention on the SpagoBI's functional aspects. So, 
	  the portlets fill whole pages, but you can form freely their 
	  layout by inserting other different portlets, according to 
	  your particular scenario.<br><br>
	  
	  <h4>Independence from the database and the operating system</h4>
	  Now, some RDBMS scripts are available, which enables you to 
	  use SpagoBI in different platform both free/open source software, 
	  than proprietary software:<br>
	  <ul>
	    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
	    <li>MySql</li>
	    <li>Oracle</li>
	    <li>DB2 (soon available).</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  In any case, there is a data access abstraction layer (Hibernate) 
	  that enable the applicative to be independent from the specific RDBMS.<br>
	  
	  SpagoBI is an application software Java-based; you can use it on 
	  different operating systems.<br><br>
	  
	  <h4>User roles</h4>
	  SpagoBI provides you with different portlets and functionalities 
	  according to different user typologies. A short user guide according 
	  to the different roles is provided in next pages.
