<table>  <tr>    <td style="text-align: justify">       The purpose of SpagoBI project is to realize a strong and organic infrastructure for the development of 
       Business Intelligence (BI) solutions.
       <br></br> 
       At present there are many free open source (FOSS) specific products realizing single particular BI aspects: 
       reporting tools, Data Mining instruments and algorithms, EAI products and so on. Each of these products is useful 
       in its specific domain but when a complete solution is needed they all put together do not give the real answer. 
       Actually only big commercial solutions may cover several Business Intelligence's aspects.  
       <br></br>
       SpagoBI will use the most interesting solutions (the best of the breed FOSS solutions) and new software components 
       in order to realize a really integrated Free Platform. The project is ambitious and very complex as well. It doesn't 
       release a package for the community but it starts  as a development project going to involve a community interested 
       on it. For this aim, the Engineering Ingegneria Informatica development team will release the architectural and 
       technical design documentation and, in the meanwhile, starts the development of the core platform, waiting for the 
       participation of other workgroups. 
       <br></br>
       Every component will be released as GNU LGPL licence in order to share, develop, complete, extend and 	 improve the 
       final platform, according to the cooperative behaviour of the free software communities.
       <br></br> 
       Spago BI will grow in time according to the development road-map and on time 
       will be revised according to the community's suggestions.
       <br></br> 
       SpagoBI will be supported in terms of professional services and maintenance by 
       Engineering Ingegneria Informatica.
