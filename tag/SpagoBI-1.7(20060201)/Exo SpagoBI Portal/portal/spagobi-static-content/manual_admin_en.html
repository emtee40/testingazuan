	<h3>Administration functions</h3>
	The administration functions are useful for the user which takes the 
	responsibility of managing the infrastructure from a technological 
	point of view. He manages:
	<ul>
	<li>the SpagoBI’s portlets organization, inside of the widest corporate 
	or dedicated portal, in order to build the most suitable view for the 
	usage type, by governing the accessibility levels to the same functions;</li>
	<li>the registration and configuration for all the analytical engines 
	used inside the platform;</li>
	<li>the functional tree-view structuring the analytical documents and 
	the access and usage user rights distribution inside the same tree-view;</li>
	<li>the extraordinary maintenance of the registered analytic documents.</li>
	</ul>
	These functions are provided by means of a single portlet; you can 
	immediately insert it into a portal environment supporting its 
	specification. <br><br>
	
	<h4>Engines configuration</h4>
	SpagoBI is suitable for the usage of several engines both for 
	all the different analytical areas (Report, OLAP, Data Mining and 
	Dashboard) and inside the same analytical area. A short list of 
	all the registered engines is available; you can add new engines, 
	erase the existing ones or reach their detailed information in 
	order to change their configuration.<br>
	The SpagoBI’s administrator has to mark the attributes that are 
	necessary for the correct usage of an engine by means of the 
	detail view. They are:
	<ul>
	<li>the engine identifying data (label, name and description);</li>
	<li>the location of the interface bringing the specific engine 
	inside SpagoBI (URL Engine);</li>
	<li>the typology of the documents that are supported by the 
	engine (Report, OLAP, Data Mining and Dashboard);</li>
	<li>the name of the driver governing the interaction with the 
	specific engine (Driver Name).</li>
	</ul>
	By means of a correct configuration you can both use the same 
	instances of the same engine inside different environments 
	(development, test, production), in order not to invalidate 
	its performances, and to use different and parallel engines 
	inside the same environments.<br><br>
	
	<h4>Functionalities management</h4>
	A functional tree-view displays the attributes of all the 
	analytical documents registered inside SpagoBI. You can create 
	and handle a multi-level structure where every node inherits 
	(by default) all its father’s rights; you can modify these 
	rights starting from the detail view when it is necessary.<br>
	The visibility rules applied to one node change according to 
	the inserted documents; they are defined for the three states 
	characterizing their approval procedure (Development, Test, 
	Release).<br><br>
	
	<h4>Documents configuration</h4>
	A list sums up all the analytical documents registered inside 
	SpagoBI reporting their main attributes. You can pass to the 
	tree-view in order to see their functional subdivision. 
	Starting from these two points of view you can go the detail page. 
	So the administrator can force the document’s state, in order 
	to solve emergency situations.
