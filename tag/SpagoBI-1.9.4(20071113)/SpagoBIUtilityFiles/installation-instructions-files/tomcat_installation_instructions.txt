If you want to install SpagoBI on your tomcat eXo Portal 1.1.3, after having launched Maven 2 command, please proceed as follows:
- copy the content of the folder "tomcat-server" (NOT the directory itself but only its content) inside your Tomcat base directory (we will refer to it as TOMCAT_HOME): overwrite the existing files;
- delete the jar hsqldb1.8.0.1.jar from TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib.

For CMS:
- open the file server.xml in TOMCAT_HOME/conf and substitute ${SERVER_HOME} with the actual path of TOMCAT_HOME in the "cms/spagobicms" resource definition.
Pay attention at the path form, also for Windows system it must contain only / separator and it must start with / (no c:\ for example).

For SpagoBITalendEngine:
- open the file talend.perl.properties in TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/SpagoBITalendEngine/WEB-INF/classes and adjust your Perl installation directory (if you want to executed Perl based jobs);
- open the file talend.properties in TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/SpagoBITalendEngine/WEB-INF/classes and substitute ${SPAGOBI_TALEND_ENGINE_HOME} with the actual path of TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/SpagoBITalendEngine.
