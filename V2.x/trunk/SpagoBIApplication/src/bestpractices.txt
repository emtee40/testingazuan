iReport Query Bestpractices:
- The names of the column alias must be specified in uppercase:
 SELECT TABLE.COLUMN COLUMN-ALIAS FROM TABLE
and not
 SELECT TABLE.COLUMN column-alias FROM TABLE

- The GROUP BY statement must contain only column name and not the alias of the
column name:
 SELECT TABLE.COLUMN COLUMN-ALIAS
 FROM TABLE
 GROUP BY TABLE.COLUMN
and not
 SELECT TABLE.COLUMN 
 FROM TABLE
 GROUP BY COLUMN-ALIAS
 
- The query must not terminate with a ; (otherwise when you execute a report in
Oracle Data Source will be displaied a message error)
 
- In the FROM statement don't use as to specificate a table alias:
 SELECT *
 FROM TABLE TABLE-ALIAS
and not
 SELECT *
 FROM TABLE AS TABLE-ALIAS

- Don't use the name RESOURCE as an alias (this is Oracle keyword)
