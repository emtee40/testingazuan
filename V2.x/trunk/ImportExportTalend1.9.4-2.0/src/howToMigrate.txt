            ===================================================


You can download  workspace for talend Open Studio 2.4,
 it contains a Job named MIGRATION_JOB, and some subjobs.

It's aim is to export data from a SpagoBI 1.9.4 metadata database and import them into a SpagoBi 2.1 metadata database.

The import database must be empty, with the exception of the table SBI_DOMAINS that must already have  been filled.

Metadata that are exported are about engines, modalities values, Analytical Drivers, checks, functionalities and roles, BiObjects, Audit, viewpoints and subreports.
Pay attention that SubObjects, Templates and Snapshots are not exported; for what concern templates user will likely have to modify them according
to new  platform needs, exspecially for OLAP and QBE documents.
