DON'T USE FILES FROM THIS FOLDER!

This folder and its subfolders contain legacy code that will be removed in due
time. For the time being some of this code might still be in use indirectly by
officially published programs and interfaces. But none of it should be invoked
directly by the user.

Thanks.
